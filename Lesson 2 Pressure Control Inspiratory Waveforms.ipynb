    "In pressure support, the trigger for switching from inspiration to expiration is based on the flow. This is always some precentage (i.e. 25%) of the peak flow and by definition this is greater than zero. Since the end expiratory flow is always positive (and we are assuming the patient is calm and relatively passive) then $P_\\text{aw} > P_\\text{plat}$. If the peak flow was 1.6L/s (100 L/min), then the airway resistance would be $ 0.25 * 1.6L/S * 10 \\text{cmH_2O}/L \\approx 4 cmH20$ and $P_\\text{plat}\\approx 11$.\n",
