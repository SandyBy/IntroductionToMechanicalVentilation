    "<details><summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "By examining the flow-time curve:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Look for end expiratory flow. If there is no end expiratory flow, that suggests the alveolar pressure and the ventilator pressure have equalized (at PEEP). If end expiratory flow is present, that means there is still a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the ventilator (Palv > Pvent), the patient is still exhaling and the alveolar pressure is higher than the set PEEP (indicating the presence of auto-peep). The servo-i will measure this for you ($\\dot{V}_\\text{ee}$) or you can use the flow-volume loops.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.\tLook at the area under the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the flow-time curve. The area under the inspiratory and expiratory limbs should be equal (the TV that goes in should be the same as what comes out). If the area under the expiratory limb is smaller than the area under the inspiratory limb, this suggests that some air is being trapped and acts as evidence of auto-peep.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Measure it directly with an expiratory hold. The ventilator will read out total peep(total peep - set peep = auto peep). \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Look for ineffective triggering. To Trigger the ventilator, a patient must decrease the alveolar pressure to a pressure below PEEP (to create a gradient of Pvent > Palv). If there is auto-peep, a patient has to have an inspiratory effort great enough to overcome the PEEP + auto-PEEP in order to trigger the ventilator. You can also measure this directly with an esophageal balloon which measures the inspiratory muscule pressure required to counter auto-peep.\n",

    "### What is the stress index?\n",
    "<details><summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "The strees index can help decide if you have adequate alveolar recruitment without overdistension -- essentially you are evaluating if the compliance ($\\frac{\\delta P}{\\delta V}$) is constant throughout the breath. If it is increasing (i.e. additional volume is increasing the pressure more than the initial volume) this suggests overdistention. If it is decreasing (i.e. additional volume increases the pressure less than the initial volume) this suggests that there is recruitable lung units. \n",
    "    \n",
    "You can evaluate the stress index by looking at the shape of the pressure-time curve during **CONSTANT** flow volume control ventilation. Typically a very slow flow rate is used. A linear increase in pressure reflects constant compliance and a stress index of 1, which suggests adequate alveolar recruitment without overdistension. If compliance worsens as the lung inflates (indicated by an upward concavity), the stress index is > 1 and the recommendation is to decrease the PEEP or TV or both.  If compliance improves as the lung inflates (indicated by a downward concavity), the stress index is < 1 and the recommendation is to increase the PEEP or TV or both.\n",
