    "# INSPIRATORY WAVEFORMS: VOLUME\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "A patient with static compliance of 0.05L/cmH2O is on VOLUME CONTROL SQUARE WAVE flow ventilation. TV is 0.5L and PEEP is 5cm H2O. Assume the patient is relaxed and not fighting the ventilator. Respiratory rate is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you achieve an IT of 1 second?\n",
    "<details><summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "IT on square wave volume is determined by flow. Flow (L/min or L/second) is constant in square wave, so if we need to get a total tidal volume of 0.5L then flow would need to be 30L/min or 0.5L/s</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What would the expiratory time be?\n",
    "<details><summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "If the respiratory rate is 15 and each inspiration is taking 1 second, then 15seconds every minute is spent on inspiration and 45 seconds is spent on expiration. 45/15 = 3 seconds which is the expiratory time</details>\n",

    "### What is the expected plateau pressure and peak inspiratory pressure?\n",
    "<details><summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "When looking at the equation of motion ($P_\\text{aw} = \\dot{V}R + \\frac{V}{C} + \\text{PEEP}$), in volume control square wave the plateau pressure is defined by $\\frac{V}{C} + \\text{PEEP}$ because during an inspiratory hold (to check the plateau pressure), flow ($\\dot{V}$) goes to zero. In order to calculate the peak inspiratory pressure, in square wave flow volume ventilation, you must know the resistance in addition to the flow, volume, compliance and PEEP:  $P_\\text{aw} = \\dot{V}R + \\frac{V}{C} + \\text{PEEP}$. KEY CONCEPT: Peak inspiratory pressure and plateau pressures are NOT equal in square wave (at peak inspiratory pressure there is still ongoing flow, but at the plateau pressure the flow is 0 L/sec)</details>\n",
